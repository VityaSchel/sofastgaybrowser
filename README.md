# pornolab.net gay browser

There was a "so long gay bowser" so I present to you: a "so fast gay browser". 

It's fast because it presents the content in a user-friendly form.

Made with Electron (and it's my second project with native apps is a porn browser out of two of them. check out other one built with Tauri [here](https://github.com/VityaSchel/mypron))

## Features

- browse the best category on pornolab.net
- download torrents
- ask copyright holder if it's ok to make a copy of their copyrighted material (download to a computer via internet network using torrent protocol)
- watch videos (only after copyright holder granted you permission)

</details>

## Developing

Install everything for Electron (Node.js, Vite etc.) and run `npm run dev` to start the app.

## Why not Tauri?

This project was initialized as a Tauri app, but later I moved it to Electron, because Tauri is just too hard to setup to use it with Node.js sidecar as a bundled binary. You are welcome to submit a PR with a working crossplatforming Tauri version of this app though!
