# pornolab.net gay browser

There was a "so long gay bowser" so I present to you: a "so fast gay browser". 

It's fast because it presents the content in a user-friendly form. Also it works on ðŸš€RustðŸš€ (ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€) so it's very fast.

Compiled with Tauri (and it's my second project on Tauri that is a porn browser out of two of them. check out other one [here](https://github.com/VityaSchel/mypron))

## Features

- browse the best category on pornolab.net
- download torrents
- ask copyright holder if it's ok to make a copy of their copyrighted material (download to a computer via internet network using torrent protocol)
- watch videos (only after copyright holder granted you permission)
